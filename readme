This work focuses on a comprehensive techno-economic evaluation of an investment in the telecommunications sector. 
Our objective is to analyze the feasibility of investing in the development and installation of a Fixed Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH) network in the city of Nice, France.
The investment will span 10 years, starting from 2023, and will include offering at least two services: a basic service and an advanced service.
The pricing of these services will be demand-driven, and the demand is expected to increase based on S-curve models that have already been calculated for the country.

The results of this evaluation will encompass revenues, expenses, as well as key techno-economic indicators like Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), and the payback period.

Furthermore, sensitivity analyses will be conducted to assess the impact of various factors on the results, such as changes in the penetration rate of demand,
Average Revenue Per User (ARPU), the total cost of the investment, and even a doubling of the population in the area.

We will comment on the results and explain the main factors influencing the differences between the best and worst-case scenarios. 
Finally, we will calculate the required investment adjustments necessary to reduce the payback period by 1 year.
